### Andy Jassy Keynote (Wednesday)

#### Business Update
* 27 billion run rate
* Growing 46% YoY in absolute revenue
* 52% of market share

#### What do builders want?
* Broadest and deepest cloud platform
* Depth of security
* Relational databases, non-relational databases and migration services
* Best compute - instances, containers, serverless
* Data transfer, block storage, object storage (s3)
* S3 is replicated across all availbility zones
* Warm and cold tiers in intelligent tiering class
* Introducing glacier deep archive - cheapest option - less than one tenth of one cent per gigabyte per month
* Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and Lustre

#### Landing in the Zone - AWS Control
* Easy way to setup and control multiple accounts

#### Time Series Data
* Launch of Amazon Timestream database
* 1000 times faster at 1/10 of cost compared to relational database
* Interpolation, approximation, and smoothing built in
* Serverless and scales up and down by Amazon

#### Amazon Quantum Ledger Database
* Ledgers with centralized trust (not blockchain)
* Healthcare, dmv, manufacturers, hr and payroll
* Cannot do with relational database to make it immutable and verifiable
* AWS already did this for transactional logs with S3, EC2... - QLDB - append only, immutable, transparent ledger
* Launch of Amazon Quantum Ledger Database - full managed ledger database with central, trusted authority (like a supply chain)
    * Transparent
    * Cryptographically verifiable
    * Transparent
    * Fast
    * Highly scalable
    * Easy to use (SQL-like properties)

#### Amazon Managed Block Chain
* Transactions with decentralized trust
* Financial institutions, small business, retail, mortgage
* Launch of Amazon Managed Block Chain
    * Choose fabric or ethereum
    * Scales to support thousands of applications
    * Easier to get started and operating
    * Simple API calls
    * Easy to move to QLDB for further analysis

#### Machine Learning
* AI services, ML services, ML frameworks and infrastructure
* Scaling tensorflow with SageMaker
    * Difficulty in scaling weights across neural network - only uses 65% of GPU
    * AWS moved efficiency to 90% of GPU - AWS-optimized tensor flow

#### Key Takeaways
* Move to S3 intelligent tiering?
* If using time series data - leverage Amazon TimeStream
